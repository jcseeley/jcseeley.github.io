      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Jase Seeley is an aspiring software developer currently attending Epicodus coding bootcamp. He resides in the Woodstock neighborhood of Portland, OR with his girlfriend, Katie. Jase has been an advocate for a plant-based lifestyle since beginning his own vegan journey in 2017. He is an avid NBA and Formula1 fan, movie buff, gamer, and craft beer enthusiast.
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>Born and raised in Concord, NH, Jase moved to Portland at the beginning of 2019. While in NH, Jase spent 8 years working for the Grappone Automotive Group in Bow, NH. He filled several different roles during his time there but eventually went on to become a used inventory manager. In 2017, he realized it was time for him to step away from the auto industry and began planning his move to the west coast. At the beginning of 2019, he packed his car, grabbed his dog and headed west. With no job and no place to live, Jase had to act fast to find steady employment and long term housing. As a beer enthusiast, Jase began seeking work in the bustling Portland beer industry. He quickly found work as draft cleaning technician for Northwest Draft Technicians.
