      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Jase Seeley is an aspiring software developer currently attending Epicodus coding bootcamp. He resides in the Woodstock neighborhood of Portland, OR with his girlfriend, Katie. Jase has been an advocate for a plant-based lifestyle since beginning his own vegan journey in 2017. He is an avid NBA and Formula1 fan, movie buff, gamer, and craft beer enthusiast.
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>Jase was born and raised in Concord, NH. While there, he spent 8 years working as a used inventory manager for the Grappone Automotive Group. He attended Manchester Community College's Automotive Technology program. After tiring of the auto industry and his home state, he decided it was time for a change. At the beginning of 2019, he left Grappone, packed his car to the brim, grabbed his dog, and headed for the west coast. Upon landing in Oregon, Jase pursued a job in the bustling Portland beer industry. He quickly found work as a draft technician at Northwest Draft. During his time here, he attended the Micro-Matic dispense institute in CA where he learned how install beer systems. After being laid off due the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, just relied on gig work to get by until deciding to enroll at Epicodus.
