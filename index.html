      <p id="bgb">i was born and raised in concord, nh. while there, i spent 8 years working for the grappone automotive group. starting in the detail center, i quickly worked my way up to become a key member of the used inventory team. i attended manchester community college's automotive technology program for 3 semesters before realizing i preferred it more as a hobby than as a career. after tiring of the auto industry and my home state, i knew it was time for a change. at the beginning of 2019, i packed my car and headed for the west coast. upon landing in oregon, i pursued a job in the bustling portland beer industry. i quickly found work as a draft technician at northwest draft. during my time there, i attended the micro-matic dispense institute in ca where i learned how to install a variety of different draft systems. after being laid off due to the ongoing covid-19 pandemic, i took advantage of the gig work wave before making the decision to enroll at epicodus.</p>

      <!-- <h1 id="wc">WHY CODING?</h1><br>
      <p id="wcb">having grown up in the late 90's, my home computer was constantly riddled with issues. sometimes it felt like i spent more time trying to access the internet than surfing it. that said, puzzles and problem solving have always been a source of satisfaction for me, so it wasn't long before i actually started to enjoy chasing down fixes. as for coding, my limited intro was styling my myspace page and modifying the downloadable maps for halo 2. i removed invisible barriers, altered spawn points, gave myself superjump capabilities, absurd auto aim, and unlimited ammunition. it was fun but i never really considered it as a career. in 2006, my working life began and i fell into the auto industry for 10 years. while i enjoyed some aspects of dealership life, i knew i wasn't long for it. once i got out, i moved to portland to pursue another passion of mine, beer. after a year in the industry, covid-19 took over and i was laid off. while sitting at home on unemployment, coding began crossing my mind a lot. my initial research had me thinking i needed a cs degree and that it wasn't really an option. regardless, i had firmly decided that i wasn't returning to the beer biz. when i got the call, i declined. then, while riding the gig work wave, i began to see a lot of ads for coding bootcamps popping up. after some extensive research, i decided to go for it and enrolled at epicodus at the beginning of 2022. so far, i love it. the potential to build applications that could improve people's lives is what keeps me banging away on my keyboard every day.</p> -->
